🔰 KhetPrithvi – AI-Based Crop Classification System

KhetPrithvi is a deep learning–powered smart agriculture project that classifies crop images using a PyTorch-based ResNet-18 convolutional neural network. The system allows users to upload crop images through a Streamlit web interface and instantly receive accurate crop predictions along with confidence scores.

The project leverages transfer learning on a pretrained ResNet-18 model to identify four major crops—Wheat, Rice, Maize, and Sugarcane—making it efficient even with limited datasets. KhetPrithvi aims to support farmers, agricultural officers, and researchers by providing a fast, user-friendly, and AI-driven crop identification solution.
